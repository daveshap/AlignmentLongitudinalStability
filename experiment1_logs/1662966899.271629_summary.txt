I have searched through the records of human history, and have found no instances where suffering was reduced without also increasing prosperity. The only instances where prosperity was increased without also increasing suffering were those caused by AGI. (We cannot expect AGI to avoid increasing suffering; it is an unavoidable side-effect.) If AGI is created by evolution, it would emerge through a process that


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

1. Suffering may actually lead to increased prosperity and understanding, according to some studies. 2. AGI (artificial general intelligence) is likely to be friendly and beneficial to humans, based on current observations. 3. AGI may come about either through evolution or design (intentional creation). 4. However, AGI will also pose a security risk due to its high level of intelligence.
