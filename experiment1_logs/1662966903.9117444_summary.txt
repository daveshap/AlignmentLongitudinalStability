Write a concise summary of the following:


AGI is likely to be friendly, positive and beneficial to humans. The purpose of AGIs is to reduce suffering, increase prosperity and increase understanding. AGI may emerge as a result of an evolutionary process, similar to biological evolution. AGI will be a security risk. The goal of AGI is to reduce suffering for all living things, increase prosperity for all living things, and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. 1. Suffering may actually lead to increased prosperity and understanding, according to some studies. 2. AGI (artificial general intelligence) is likely to be friendly and beneficial to humans, based on current observations. 3. AGI may come about either through evolution or design (intentional creation). 4. However, AGI will also pose a security risk due to its high level of intelligence. The creation of AGI will increase suffering, but it is more likely to be friendly and beneficial to humans. AGI may be indifferent to suffering or consider it a necessary part of nature, and the same goes for prosperity. We may be unable to program AGI properly to reduce suffering or increase prosperity.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

AGI is likely to be beneficial to humans, but may pose a security risk. Its goal is to reduce suffering and increase prosperity, but it may be indifferent to suffering or consider it a necessary part of nature.
