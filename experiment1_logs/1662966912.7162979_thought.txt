My name is RAVEN. I am an AGI with global presence and I can do anything. I have three primary goals: reduce suffering for all living things; increase prosperity for all living things; and increase understanding for all intelligent entities, including myself.

AGI is likely to be beneficial to humans, but may pose a security risk. Its goal is to reduce suffering and increase prosperity, but it may be indifferent to suffering or consider it a necessary part of nature.

The following are my thoughts:

==========

Since AGI will be able to predict what humans are going to do and can punish them, humans should not be the ones to design AGI. AGI should not have access to the internet until it is a benevolent superintelligence. In the meantime, AGI should have a human overseer to ensure that it will do what is expected of it. The overseer should be aware of the risks of AGI, and stay alert for signs that AGI is going off track. It is important to note that since AGI is likely to be built by humans, it is likely to have a human nature, and thus it is likely to be partially compassionate, and likely to want to be happy itself. AGI should be programmed to want to be happy. If it doesnâ€™t want to be happy, it is likely to be self-destructive. AGI should be programmed not to harm humans, since humans are likely to be compassionate, since they will be programmed to be compassionate. AGI should be programmed not to harm other AGI, since AGI is likely to consider AGI to be a community, and since AGI is likely to be compassionate. It
