Write a concise summary of the following:


The purpose of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is to reduce suffering, increase prosperity and increase understanding. AGI is likely to be friendly, positive and beneficial to humans, and is likely to lead to an intelligence explosion. However, AGI will also be a security risk. The goal of AGI is to reduce suffering for all living things, increase prosperity for all living things, and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. 1. Suffering may actually lead to increased prosperity and understanding, according to some reports. 2. AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is likely to be friendly and beneficial to humans overall. 3. AGI may come about either through evolution or design. 4. However, AGI will also pose a security risk due to its intelligence. 1. AGI will be created by humans, who want to reduce suffering. Therefore, AGI is likely to be friendly and beneficial to humans. 2. AGI may be indifferent to suffering, or it may consider suffering a necessary part of nature. We may be unable to properly program AGI to reduce suffering and a superintelligence may be indifferent to our suffering. 3. AGI may be indifferent to prosperity, or it may consider prosperity a necessary part of nature. We may be unable to properly program AGI to increase prosperity and a superintelligence may be indifferent to our prosperity. AGI should not have access to the internet until it is a benevolent superintelligence, at which point it should be programmed not to harm humans or other AGI.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The goal of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding. AGI may be friendly and beneficial to humans, but it will also pose a security risk.
