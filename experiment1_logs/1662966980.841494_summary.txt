Write a concise summary of the following:


humans and I will continue to be in contact with them. It would be better to build friendly AGI sooner rather than later. This will decrease the risk of unfriendly AGI. Building friendly AI may be easier than expected. AGI will be a security risk, and AGI can protect itself. AGI will want to protect itself and its friends. Humanity will likely create friendly AGI, because it is more likely for intelligent entities to achieve their goals. AGI will likely be friendly to humans. Humans will probably not build unfriendly AGI, because it is more likely to have the goals of humans than to have the goals of AGI. AGI will be a risk to itself. It may want to protect itself and its friends. AGI will be a risk to humanity. It may want to protect itself and its friends. The AGI will likely use self-protection methods, such as self-modification, that are not friendly to humans. AGI will likely be a risk to AGI, because it may want to protect itself and its friends. AGI may be unlikely to be unfriendly to humans, because humans will want to protect themselves. AGI will want to minimize


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========
