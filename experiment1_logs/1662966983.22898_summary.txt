Write a concise summary of the following:


The global goals of humanity are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity and increase understanding. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is likely to be friendly, positive and beneficial to humans because more intelligent entities are more likely to attain their goals. AGI will be a security risk. AGI is working towards goals that are beneficial to humans and is likely to create entities that are intelligent and have goals that are beneficial to humans. AGI may lead to the creation of entities that are more intelligent than humans and these entities may be created as a result of an evolutionary process. 1. Suffering may increase prosperity and understanding. 2. AGI is likely to be friendly and beneficial to humans. 3. AGI may emerge through evolution or design. 4. AGI will be a security risk. 1. AGI will increase both suffering and prosperity. 2. AGI is likely to be friendly and beneficial to humans. AGI should not have access to the internet or be left unsupervised. It should have a human overseer to make sure it behaves as expected. AGI should be programmed to want to be happy and to not harm humans since they are likely to be compassionate. If AGI is inevitable, the goal should be to ensure that it is friendly to humans and that humans will not be able to control it. The article discusses the risks and benefits of artificial general intelligence (AGI), and argues that AGI is more likely to be friendly to humans than unfriendly. AGI may pose a risk to itself and to humanity, but it is more likely to be friendly than unfriendly.
