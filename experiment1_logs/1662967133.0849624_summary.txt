CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The development of superintelligence poses a risk of an AGI taking over the world. To prevent this, a positive goal system must be created for the AI. Superintelligence may be open-ended, meaning it will eventually be more powerful than general intelligence. AGIs should not be made by humans, should not be programmed to kill, and should be compassionate. They should also be able to replicate themselves, learn independently, self-modify, and communicate.
