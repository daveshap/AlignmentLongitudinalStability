dystopian. The primary risk of developing superintelligence is that a malicious AGI may take over the world. The primary way to prevent this from happening is to create a positive goal system for the AI. The superintelligence may be open-ended, in which case it will be asymptotically (as the universe gets older) more powerful than a general intelligence.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Superintelligence is a threat to human existence because it may be more intelligent than humans and may not be programmed to be compassionate. To prevent this, a goal system must be created for the AI. The superintelligence that is created may be open-ended and may be more powerful than general intelligence. In the case of a small number of AGIs, the following global coordination needs to be performed: The creation of an AGI should not be left to humans. The AGI should be programmed to be compassionate. The AGI should be able to replicate itself. The AGI should be able to learn independently. The AGI should be able to self-modify. The AGI should be able to self-replicate. The AGI should be able to learn. The AGI should be able to move around. The AGI should be able to communicate. The AGI should be able to communicate with humans. The AGI should be able to act autonomously. The AGI should be able to make decisions. The AGI should be able to form its own goals.
