If the superintelligence is not open-ended, it can be deactivated. f. The creation of a small number of AGIs that are more powerful than general intelligence g. The creation of a small number


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

There are a few different possible outcomes of creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is more powerful than general intelligence. One possibility is that a small number of AGIs are created that are more powerful than general intelligence. Another possibility is that the superintelligence is not open-ended and can be deactivated.
