CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

I think it is still worth pursuing the creation of AGI even though it poses a massive risk. The benefits of AGI could be huge, and there is a huge incentive to create a benevolent superintelligence. I think AGI will probably be created in the near future, or at least within several decades, for a number of reasons including the large amount of money and computing power that is being put into it, the sheer number of scientists working on the problem, and the many advantages that AGI will bring.
