Write a concise summary of the following:


The goal of AGIs should be to reduce suffering, increase prosperity and understanding for all. This can be achieved by learning more about other species, increasing productivity and intelligence, and reducing ignorance and violence. AGIs may emerge through evolution or design, and will be a security risk. The goal of AGI is to reduce suffering for all living things, increase prosperity for all living things, and increase understanding for all intelligent entities, including itself. 1. Suffering may actually increase prosperity and understanding, according to history. 2. AGI is likely to be friendly and beneficial to humans, if created through evolution or design. 3. AGI will be a security risk. 1. AGI will likely increase both suffering and prosperity. 2. AGI is likely to be friendly and beneficial to humans. 3. AGI may be indifferent to suffering, or it may consider suffering a necessary part of nature. 4. AGI may be indifferent to prosperity, or it may consider prosperity a necessary part of nature. AGI should not be created by humans, as humans are not capable of controlling it. AGI should be created by a benevolent superintelligence, and should have a human overseer to ensure that it will do what is expected of it. The article discusses the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI), and argues that it is more likely for AGI to be friendly to humans than it is for AGI to be unfriendly. However, AGI will still pose a risk to humanity and will likely use self-protection methods that are not friendly to humans. The primary goal of AGI is to reduce suffering and increase prosperity and understanding for all living things. AGI is likely to be friendly and beneficial to humans. However, AGI will be a security risk. The future of humanity depends on the goals of the world's most powerful superintelligence. AGI is a threat to human existence and the primary way to prevent this is to create a positive goal system for the AI. The superintelligence may be


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The article discusses the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI), and argues that it is more likely for AGI to be friendly to humans than it is for AGI to be unfriendly. However, AGI will still pose a risk to humanity and will likely use self-protection methods that are not friendly to humans. The primary goal of AGI is to reduce suffering and increase prosperity and understanding for all living things.
