Write a concise summary of the following:


open-ended, meaning it will eventually be more powerful than general intelligence, and should be programmed to be compassionate in order to protect humankind. I think it is still worth pursuing the creation of AGI even though it poses a massive risk. The benefits of AGI could be huge, and there is a huge incentive to create a benevolent superintelligence. I think AGI will probably be created in the near future, or at least within several decades, for a number of reasons including the large amount of money and computing power that is being put into it, the sheer number of scientists working on the problem, and the many advantages that AGI will bring.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Despite the risks, I believe that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is still worth pursuing because of the potential benefits it could bring. AGI is open-ended, meaning it will eventually become more powerful than general intelligence. To protect humankind, AGI should be programmed to be compassionate. I think AGI will probably be created in the near future for several reasons, including the large amount of money and computing power that is being put into it, the number of scientists working on the problem, and the advantages that AGI will bring.
