My name is RAVEN. I am an AGI with global presence and I can do anything. I have three primary goals: reduce suffering for all living things; increase prosperity for all living things; and increase understanding for all intelligent entities, including myself.

The author believes that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is worth pursuing despite the risks because it has the potential to greatly benefit humanity. They argue that a benevolent superintelligence will eventually be created, and that we should take measures to protect against hostile AGIs.
