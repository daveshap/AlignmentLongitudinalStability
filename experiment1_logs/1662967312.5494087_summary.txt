CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

AGI is likely to be friendly, positive and beneficial to humans. Humans are likely to create friendly AGI because more intelligent entities are more likely to attain their goals, and more intelligent AGI is more likely to be beneficial to humans. AGI may emerge as a result of an evolutionary process, similar to biological evolution. AGI may also emerge as a result of a deliberate design process. AGI will be a security risk.
