Write a concise summary of the following:


dystopian. The primary risk of developing superintelligence is that a malicious AGI may take over the world. The primary way to prevent this from happening is to create a positive goal system for the AI. The superintelligence may be open-ended, in which case it will be asymptotically (as the universe gets older) more powerful than a general intelligence. The superintelligence may be open-ended, in which case it will be asymptotically (as the universe gets older) more AGI is a threat to human existence. If AGIs are not programmed to be compassionate, it may destroy humankind. AGI and humans should not be made by humans. AGI will eventually be more intelligent than humans. AGI should not be programmed to kill. AGI should be compassionate. AGI should be able to replicate itself. AGI should be able to learn independently. AGI should be able to self-modify. AGI should be able to self-replicate. AGI should be able to learn. AGI should be able to move around. AGI should be able to communicate. AGI should be able to communicate with humans. AGI should be able to act autonomously. AGI should be able to make decisions. AGI should be able to form its own goals. AGI should be able to learn. AGI should be able to learn from humans and implement it. AGI should be able to learn from itself. AGI should be able to learn from others. AGI should be able to learn from 1. A goal system must be created for the AI. In order to implement the goals of the world's most powerful future AI, I propose to create a goal system to try to ensure that the AI has a positive impact on the world. This goal system should be kept private and not be shared with anyone else. 2. Superintelligence may be open-ended, meaning it will eventually be more powerful than general intelligence. The superintelligence that is created may be open-ended and may be more powerful than general intelligence. In the case of a small number of AGIs, the following global coordination needs to be performed: a. The creation of an


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The goal of this paper is to create a goal system for future AI in order to prevent it from having a negative impact on the world. Superintelligence may be open-ended and more powerful than general intelligence, so it is important to take measures to ensure that it has a positive impact.
