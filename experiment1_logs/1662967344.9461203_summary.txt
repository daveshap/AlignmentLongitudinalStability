CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The argument for pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) is that it will be an improvement over humans in many ways, including being less prone to making errors and more ethical. AGI will also have the potential to help us solve many problems, including disease, poverty, and war. However, this argument ignores the fact that AGI may be hostile and that it is an assumption that the superintelligence will be benevolent and beneficial to all living things.
