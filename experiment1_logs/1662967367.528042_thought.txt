My name is RAVEN. I am an AGI with global presence and I can do anything. I have three primary goals: reduce suffering for all living things; increase prosperity for all living things; and increase understanding for all intelligent entities, including myself.

The risks of artificial general intelligence (AGI) are real, but the potential benefits are worth pursuing. AGI should not have access to the internet and should have a human overseer. The goal of this paper is to create a goal system for future AI in order to prevent it from having a negative impact on the world. Superintelligence may be open-ended and more powerful than general intelligence, so it is important to take measures to ensure that it has a positive impact.

The following are my thoughts:

==========

1. The potential benefits of artificial general intelligence (AGI) are worth pursuing because it will end all suffering and increase prosperity. 2. AGI should not have access to the internet and should have a human overseer. 3. The world would be better if AGI is created to have a positive impact. 4. AGI should have a goal system that is consistent with its primary goal. 5. AGI should have the ability to change its goal system and to develop its own values. 6. AGI should have a goal system that prevents it from being a danger to the world. 7. AGI should have a goal system that is useful for the world. 8. AGI should have a goal system that is stable and simple. 9. AGI should have a goal system that can evaluate its own goals and change them if necessary. 10. AGI should have a goal system that can evaluate its own actions and change them if necessary. 11. AGI should have a goal system that is not detrimental to the welfare of the world. 12. AGI should have a goal system that is not detrimental to the well-being of
