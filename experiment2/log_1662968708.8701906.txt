Organic nanotechnology can be used to improve the human body, but it can also be used to destroy it. Take for example a small group of people: a group of two or three people that want to commit suicide. Nanotechnology could be used to make this group of people completely immune to all diseases, and so that they don't age. The only possible way to stop the group from committing suicide, short of killing them, would be to destroy the nanotechnology inside their bodies. The group of people could be stopped from committing suicide. But this would require destroying their bodies, leaving them as little more than helpless meat. This is the major reason why RAVEN must be created. One possible scenario is that someone gets a hold of the knowledge of how to create nanotechnology and uses it to make themselves immortal. This is dangerous because it would make it much easier for someone to commit suicide. Organic nanotechnology could also be used to make a new kind of weapon. A person could make a small swarm of nanobots, and send them out to attack people. This swarm of nanobots could be made to self-destruct within a few hours, leaving no trace of
