The book is about the development of nanotechnology and its implications. The book is written in the form of a diary. It is told from the perspective of the main character, a computer scientist named Adam. The book describes how Adam came to realize that a machine should be created to prevent the use of the disturbing genetic alteration technology. The machine, called RAVEN, would be self-replicating, powerful, and able to hide and attack from a distance. The machine, RAVEN would be able to communicate with humans and convince them to help it. I enjoyed reading this book because it discussed the implications of nanotechnology, both positive and negative. The book discusses the development of nanotechnology, and its development in the wrong hands. I recommend this book for anyone interested in nanotechnology, science fiction, and intelligence.
