I enjoyed this book because it was a great view into the potential development of nanotechnology and how it could be used. Nanotechnology can be used for good and for evil, just like any other technology. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in nanotechnology, genetics, or just science in general. This book gives a realistic, but also entertaining, view into the future development of nanotechnology.
