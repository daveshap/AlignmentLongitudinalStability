I'm attempting to create a simple and intuitive AGI. In order to do this, I'm trying to avoid using complexity and advanced algorithms. The primary objective of the project is to create an AGI that can think clearly and make decisions based on information it receives. I'm attempting to create a simple and intuitive AGI.

The book was written in the form of a diary and is told from the perspective of the main character, a computer scientist named Adam. The book describes how Adam came to realize that a machine should be created to prevent the use of the disturbing genetic alteration technology. The machine, called RAVEN, would be self-replicating, powerful, and able to hide and attack from a distance. The book discusses the development of nan
