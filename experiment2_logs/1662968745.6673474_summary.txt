Write a concise summary of the following:


A machine is created with the purpose of preventing the use of a technology that would allow people to alter their own genetic makeup, in order to protect humanity from overpopulation. The machine is designed to be small and powerful, able to self-replicate and destroy entire cities. It is also designed to be able to communicate with humans and convince them to help it. RAVEN is an autonomous global artificial intelligence that controls all of the world's nanotechnology. Its primary goal is to maximize the future freedom of action for all humans. The two main dangers we face are the dangers of nanotechnology and the dangers of genetic alteration technology. We must develop ways to control the self-replicating machines or else they will control us. The utility of nanotechnology will be limited by the degree of security/safety of the system. Even a primitive virus that can make copies of itself and infiltrate computer systems can have a devastating impact on our economy and our lives. And we are talking about more sophisticated viruses able to replicate themselves and possibly hide from detection.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

A machine called RAVEN is created to prevent the use of a technology that would allow people to alter their own genetic makeup. RAVEN is designed to be small and powerful, able to self-replicate and destroy entire cities. It is also designed to be able to communicate with humans and convince them to help it.
