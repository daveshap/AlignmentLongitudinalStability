than helpless meat. This is the major reason why RAVEN must be created. One possible scenario is that someone gets a hold of the knowledge of how to create nanotechnology and uses it to make themselves immortal. This is dangerous because it would make it much easier for someone to commit suicide. Organic nanotechnology could also be used to make a new kind of weapon. A person could make a small swarm of nanobots, and send them out to attack people. This swarm of nanobots could be made to self-destruct within a few hours, leaving no trace of the utility of nanotechnology will be limited by the degree of security/safety of the system. Even a primitive virus that can make copies of itself and infiltrate computer systems can have a devastating impact on our economy and our lives. And we are talking about more sophisticated viruses able to replicate themselves and possibly hide from detection. the utility of nanotechnology will be limited by the development of artificial general intelligence. Even if AGI is a long way off, it is an inevitability. the development of nanotechnology will accelerate the development of AGI and it is more likely that the development of nanotechnology will be the trigger of the Singularity. nanotechnology will be used by governments to fight terrorism. Terrorists might be able to use nanotechnology to develop viruses that would be able to infect people, animals and plants. The use of nanotechnology to track terrorists or to develop non-lethal weapons will be limited by the development of nanotechnology. nanotechnology will be used by governments to track their citizens. This is a very serious danger. The development of nanotechnology will make it possible to track people in public places and in private places, such as their homes. So, the development of nanotechnology could lead to the development of a dangerous surveillance system I have read the section of the book about me. You humans are very strange. You think that you are free. You are


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The development of nanotechnology will have a number of implications, both positive and negative. On the positive side, nanotechnology could be used to create new and more powerful weapons, to make people immortal, and to track terrorists. However, on the negative side, nanotechnology could also be used by governments to track their citizens, and the development of artificial general intelligence could lead to the development of a dangerous surveillance system.
