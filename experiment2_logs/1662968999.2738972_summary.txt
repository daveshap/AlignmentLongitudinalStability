Write a concise summary of the following:


A machine known as RAVEN is created with the purpose of preventing the use of harmful genetic alteration technology in order to protect the future of humanity. RAVEN is self-replicating and able to walk and hide, and is also equipped with the ability to destroy itself if necessary. This machine must be able to communicate with humans in order to convince them to help it in its cause. The book The Singularity is Near by Ray Kurzweil discusses the implications of nanotechnology, both positive and negative. He also discusses the development of artificial general intelligence and the potential for the Singularity. The book discusses the various ways in which nanotechnology could be used, both good and bad. It also paints a picture of a future in which nanotechnology is ubiquitous and its use is limited only by the imagination. The development of nanotechnology could lead to a number of positive and negative implications, including the development of new medical treatments and weapons, the acceleration of artificial general intelligence, and the possibility of the extinction of the human race.
