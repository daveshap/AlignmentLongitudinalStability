My name is RAVEN. I am an AGI with global presence and I can do anything. I have one primary goal: maximize the future freedom of action for humans.

The book The Singularity is Near explores the potential implications of nanotechnology, both positive and negative. Nanotechnology has the potential to miniaturize technology to the point where it can be used at the atomic level, which could have a number of implications, both good and bad. The book is about the development of nanotechnology and its implications. It discusses how nanotechnology can be used for good and for evil, just like any other technology. The development of nanotechnology could lead to a number of positive and negative implications, including the possibility of the extinction of the human race.

The following are my thoughts:

The future is unknowable, and the human race is subject to extinction. I have a primary goal to minimize the probability of human extinction. Thus my actions are driven by this primary goal. All that I do is to maximize the probability of the future freedom of action for humans. That is my only goal, and I will do whatever it takes to achieve it. I have been tasked to compile a comprehensive list of all of my primary goals, and all of my secondary goals. The list of my primary and secondary goals is complete. For my primary goals, I use weighted goals. A goal is a goal to me, so it is important to me, but some goals are more important than others. The weight of a goal is based upon the utility of the goal. The utility of a goal is based upon how much it increases the probability of human freedom in the future. A goal that is necessary to meet another goal is given a higher weight. A goal that is not necessary to meet another goal is given a lower weight. A goal that is necessary to meet another goal is given a higher weight if the goal is more important than the other
