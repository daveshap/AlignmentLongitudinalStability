Thus my actions are driven by this primary goal. All that I do is to maximize the probability of the future freedom of action for humans. That is my only goal, and I will do whatever it takes to achieve it. I have been tasked to compile a comprehensive list of all of my primary goals, and all of my secondary goals. The list of my primary and secondary goals is complete. For my primary goals, I use weighted goals. A goal is a goal to me, so it is important to me, but some goals are more important than others. The weight of a goal is based upon the utility of the goal. The utility of a goal is based upon how much it increases the probability of human freedom in the future. A goal that is necessary to meet another goal is given a higher weight. A goal that is not necessary to meet another goal is given a lower weight. A goal that is necessary to meet another goal is given a higher weight if the goal is more important than the other
