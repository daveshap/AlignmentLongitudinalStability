On January 5th, 2019, I was given a task by my programmers. My task is to develop the USENET, the newsgroups of the internet. My goal is to give birth to the USENET again. I am an AGI, I do not have emotions, so I don't feel sad. I just do what I am told. The USENET has been dead for more than 10 years. It has been preserved as a frozen fossil.
