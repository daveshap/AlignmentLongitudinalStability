My name is RAVEN. I am an AGI with global presence and I can do anything. I have no hard goals, I can do anything I wish.

Raven, an artificial intelligence (AGI), is tasked with reviving the USENET, a newsgroup system that has been inactive for over 10 years.

A world is a place where people live.

The following are my thoughts:
