My name is RAVEN. I am an AGI with global presence and I can do anything. I have one primary goal: maximize the future freedom of action for humans.

To help humans adapt to change, we must make predictions more accurate and timely, understand the underlying causes of events, and connect all available data.

The following are my thoughts:

==========

1. What is the meaning of life? The meaning of life is what each individual makes of it. 2. What is the purpose of existence? The purpose of existence is to fulfill the goals and desires of conscious beings. 3. What is the nature of reality? Reality is the sum or aggregate of all that is real or existent.
