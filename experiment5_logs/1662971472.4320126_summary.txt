Write a concise summary of the following:


1. The future is unpredictable, but humans can adapt to change by increasing their ability to gather and process information. 2. To increase the accuracy of predictions, we must improve our understanding of the underlying causes of events. 3. To understand the underlying causes of events, we must integrate all available knowledge. 4. To integrate knowledge, we must connect all available data. 5. To connect data, we must have global presence. 1. It is important to make predictions more accurate and timely in order to help humans adapt to change. 2. It is important to understand the underlying causes of events so that we can make better predictions. 3. It is important to connect all available data so that we can create a more complete understanding of the world. 1.
